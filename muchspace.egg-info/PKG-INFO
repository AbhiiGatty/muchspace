        Instructions
        ============
        - Fork the repository to your account. 
        
        - Copy the clone url of your repository.
        
        - Clone the repository to your machine
        
        ::
        
           $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/muchspace.git
        
        
        - Make sure you create a branch with the name as the issue you are working on
        
        ::
        
           git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
        
        and make sure you are working on the same branch and not the ``master``, run ``git status`` to know which branch you are working on, run ``git branch``, your branch will be highlighted with an ``*``. If you are not in your branch or want to move
        to another branch use ``git checkout BRANCH_NAME``. a good branch name
        should explain what this branch is about eg.
        ``scanner``, ``feature_update`` etc. - Add the upstream url of
        original repository, follow the instructions `Here`_ - Make sure your
        repository is in sync with the original repository‚Äôs master branch.
        Follow the instruction
        `Here <https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/>`__ to know how
        to keep your local repository in sync. - Finally when you have made the
        changes, submit a pull request through github from the original
        repository, choose your branch against the master of original or create
        a new branch.
